<!-- Assignment #3:

For this assignment I wanted to create a site that tells people their future. 
I decide to let tweets from Twitter predict users Friday’s. When you enter my site
you have to wait until the title “Twitter knows what you will be doing this Friday…” 
finishes typing out and then users can press on the button to discover their Friday. 
Users will receive tweets that contain either the hashtag of Friday, Friday night, 
TGIF, or Night out. Sometimes the tweets will be something completely random, but 
then users are able to either refresh the page or press the button again. 

Problems that I encountered with this assignment and was not able to fix was trying 
to make the site responsive, retrieve the full tweet from Twitter and the button lags 
and users may have to press on the button multiple times before receiving a tweet.

I added the code to retrieve full tweets but it only works on regular tweets and 
not on Re-tweets. The button tends to only work the first time properly but after a
couple refreshes, tweets take a while to show. (Don’t know if this is because I “ran out of tweets”)
